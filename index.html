      <h3 class="Introduction-title"> Meet the Family </h3>
      <p> Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Encanto tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia… in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift, from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, that is: Mirabel. But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she—the only ordinary Madrigal—might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.

        <h4 class="Character-name"> Mirabel </h4>
        <h5 class="Character-voice">Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz)</h5>
        <p>Mirabel is the only child in her extraordinary family who wasn’t blessed with a magical gift. She’s determined to prove that she belongs—denying to everyone, including herself, that she feels all alone… even in her own house. Still, there’s something very special about Mirabel; her family just hasn’t figured out what that is just yet! “Mirabel reminds me of myself at her age—headstrong yet unsure, full of wonder and imagination but sometimes held back by self-doubt,” Beatriz recently said.

<!-- Character Abuela -->

        <h4 class="Character-name"> Abuela </h4>
        <h5 class="Character-voice"> Abuela Alma (voice of María Cecilia Botero) </h5>
        <p>Alma is the matriarch of the Madrigal family. Her steadfast determination and unwavering hope led her to the magical Encanto, where she raised triplets Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. To her surprise and delight, each of her children was blessed with a magical gift upon their 5th birthday, and the tradition continued with each of their children—except for Mirabel. Abuela (which means “grandmother” in Spanish) values the gifts given to each of her family members, ensuring that they are used to benefit and protect their community, and to honor the sacrifice of Abuelo (“grandfather”) Pedro.
